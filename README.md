This code is for language modeling with transformers.
Text classification task and masked language modeling has been implemented.


-  `./src/base.py`: self attnetion and transformer block
-  `./src/transformer.py`: network architecture for text classification
-  `./experiments/classify.py`: training text classifier network 
-  `./experiments/masked_language_modeling`: Hugging face-based model for masked language modeling
